## Description

Plantsy is an interactive site where users can get, store, and modify information about plants they own. Features currently in development will allow users to share user-generated content with other users. 

We envision Plantsy serving as a comprehensive hub for new and experienced gardeners to find and share information about plant varieties, keep track of their personal plant collections, store individualized care requirements, and connect with other gardeners.

Plantsy is in development. A basic, functional framework is currently deployed on Heroku.

## Usage

Visitors and users may view the master list of plant varieties by clicking "Plants". Varieties, listed by scientific and common name, appear on left as entries which may be expanded to show basic care information and a link to the full plant profile. PLant profiles include a photo and more detailed care information. Logged-in users will see the option to add the plant to their collection.

New Users may create an account by following the "Login" link in the top right corner and selecting "sign-up." They will be prompted to enter a name, email, and password.

Once logged-in, users are able to view or modify their personal plant collection ("My Plants" --/users), view the profiles and collections of other gardeners ("Gardeners" --/gardeners), and add plants from the master list of varieties ("Plants" --/plants) to their collection by following the "Add Plant" link on the plant profile. Once added, users may modify or add information to the plant profile by clicking the "Edit" button. From their personal page ("My Plants" --/users), users may generate entirely new plant profiles by clicking "Add New Plant" or delete plants from their collection by clicking "Delete Plant."
